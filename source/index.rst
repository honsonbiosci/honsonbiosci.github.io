Introduction
============

My name is Drew Honson. I am a fifth year graduate student in the laboratory of Mitch Guttman at Caltech. I am creating this website to share wet lab protocols and software packages for molecular biology that I have written. My hope is to provide inexpensive replacements to common kits and well-documented code to support reproducible reagent generation and data analysis.
